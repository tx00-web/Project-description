### Project Ideas

> **If you don't have a project yet**, you can consider one of the followings:

1. **Task Management App**: Create a task management application where users can register, log in, and manage their tasks. Users should be able to create, update, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as completed. Use MongoDB to store task data, Express.js for the API, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the server.

2. **E-commerce Platform**: Build a basic e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Implement features like product search, category filtering, user authentication, and order history. Use MongoDB to store product and user data, and React for the frontend.

3. **Blogging Platform**: Develop a blogging website where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts. Include user authentication, comment sections, and the ability to categorize posts. Use MongoDB to store blog data, Express.js for the API, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the server.

4. **Social Media Clone**: Create a simplified version of a social media platform like Twitter or Instagram. Allow users to post updates, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and have a profile page. Use MongoDB for storing user data and posts, Express.js for the API, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the server.

5. **Weather Dashboard**: Develop a weather dashboard that displays current weather conditions and forecasts for a given location. Users can enter a city name or use geolocation for weather updates. Utilize a weather API to fetch weather data. MongoDB can be used to store user preferences for saved locations.

6. **Personal Finance Tracker**: Build a personal finance tracker that allows users to log their income and expenses. Provide visualizations of spending patterns and income trends. MongoDB can store financial transactions, while React can be used to create interactive graphs and charts.

7. **Recipe Sharing App**: Develop a platform for users to share and discover recipes. Allow users to create and edit their own recipes, as well as search and browse recipes by category. MongoDB can store recipe data, and users can use React to create and format recipes.

8. **Portfolio Website**: Create a portfolio website for users to showcase their work and skills. Include sections for projects, about me, contact information, and possibly a blog. Use React for building the components and sections.

Here are three more project ideas for students learning the MERN stack:

9. **Fitness Tracking App**: Build a fitness tracking application that allows users to log their workouts, track progress over time, and set fitness goals. Users can input exercises, sets, reps, and weights for each workout session. MongoDB can store user data and exercise logs, while React can be used to display charts and graphs showing progress.

10. **Job Board Platform**: Create a job board where employers can post job listings and job seekers can search and apply for jobs. Implement features such as filtering by location, job type, and skill requirements. Users can have profiles with their resumes and application history. MongoDB can store job and user data, and Express.js can handle API requests.

11. **Language Learning App**: Develop a platform for learning languages, incorporating vocabulary exercises, quizzes, and flashcards. Users can select the language they want to learn and track their progress. Implement interactive components using React, and use MongoDB to store user profiles and learning progress.
