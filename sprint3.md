### Overview:

Sprint 3 is a significant step forward in our projects' development.  Here's what you can expect:

1. User Authentication and Authorization: One of the core features we'll be adding in Sprint 3 is user authentication and authorization. This means that we will enable users to create accounts, log in, and access certain parts of our projects based on their roles and permissions. 

2. Deployment to the Cloud: Another significant milestone in Sprint 3 is deploying our projects to the cloud. This means that our applications will be accessible to users on the internet. Cloud deployment offers several advantages, including scalability, accessibility, and reliability. We will explore strategies to make our projects accessible to a wider audience.

### Key Tasks for Sprint 3:

- Design and implement user registration and login functionality.
- Develop role-based access control to determine what users can and cannot do within the application.
- Ensure that data flows smoothly between the front-end and back-end components.
- Choose cloud platforms and deploy both the front-end and back-end of our projects.
 
### Expectations:

- Collaboration and communication within your project teams are crucial. Ensure that all team members are on the same page and contributing effectively.
- Be prepared to troubleshoot and solve technical challenges as they arise. Problem-solving is a key skill in web development.
