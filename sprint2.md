# Sprint 2 - Front-End/Back-End Integration

### Deadline

- 2023-09-17 at 23:59

### Overview:

Welcome to the second sprint of our project work! This part focuses on enhancing the user interface (UI) and integrating both the front-end and back-end components of your projects. These skills are crucial for developing a fully functional web application.

### Sprint Objectives:

By the end of this sprint, you should be able to connect your front-end React app to the back-end API. This connection enables data transfer and interaction between the user interface and the server.

### Key Milestones:

- **Week 4 of Web Courses (After September 17, 2023):** This marks the point when you should aim to have your front-end and back-end components connected and interacting effectively.

**Baseline Code:** In the upcoming week, you will receive baseline code for both the Backend and Front End. While starting from scratch is an option, using the provided code is recommended for efficiency.

**Study the Code:** Take the time to understand the logic behind the provided code. This will save you from reinventing the wheel and ensure you're building on a solid foundation.

**CSS Refresher:** CSS plays a pivotal role in web development. As part of this sprint, we'll focus on refreshing our CSS skills, particularly the use of the flexbox layout. Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating responsive and flexible layouts. I highly recommend watching this [Flexbox Crash Course](https://youtu.be/3YW65K6LcIA) to strengthen your CSS skills.

**Expectations:** This sprint is a significant step in your project's development. Collaboration within your groups is essential. Ensure that your UI is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. The successful integration of front-end and back-end components is critical for a functional application.
